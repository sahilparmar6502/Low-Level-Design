1. How Thread Executors and Thread Pools are connected?
- Executors are ther interface
- Thread Pools are actual implementation behind that interface

- Executors -> Job Manager
- Thread Pools -> Group of Worker

2. What if we don't write executor.shutdown()?
- java internally creates Non-Deamon threads for the Pools
- Non-Deamon Threads keep the java application alive.
- JVM will not shut down until all the Non-Deamon Threads finish execution or are explicitly terminated.

-> executor.shutdown() -> No more tasks will be submitted. Shut everything down.
